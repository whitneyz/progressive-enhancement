<h2>The story</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
    commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away</q>. This is most <em
            class="badwords">unfortunate</em>
    . The farmer
    said, <q class="farmer">Maybe</q>. The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses
    with it, and in the
    evening everybody
    came back and said, <q class="villagers"> Oh, isn’t that <em class="goodwords">lucky</em></q> . What a <em
            class="goodwords">great</em> turn
    of events. <q class="villagers">You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again
    said,<q class="farmer">Maybe</q>.
</p>

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The
    neighbors then said, <q class="villagers"> Oh dear, that’s too <em class="badwords">bad</em></q> , and the farmer
    responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
    The next
    day the conscription
    officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again
    all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers"><em class="goodwords">Isn’t that great</em></q> !
    Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe</q>
</p>

<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
    tell
    whether anything that happens in it is <em class="goodwords">good</em> or <em class="badwords">bad</em> — because
    you never know what will be the
    consequence of the
    <em class="badwords">misfortune</em> ; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="goodwords">good</em>
    fortune.

<p>Here is this dialog in the form of a table</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Event</th>
        <th><em class="goodwords">Good</em> or <em class="badwords">Bad</em> ?</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td> Lose a horse</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Win more horses</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Son <em class="badwords">injury</em></td>
        <td>Maybe</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Avoid <em class="badwords">war</em></td>
        <td>Maybe</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p> Table representing the farmer's philosophy.</p>


<p>Conclusion
    <em class="goodwords">Good</em> and <em class="badwords">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em
            class="goodwords">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not
    <em class="goodwords">good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
