<h2>The story</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
    commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer
    said, <strong>“Maybe</strong>.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
    evening everybody
    came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again
    said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p>

<a> href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_upon_a_time" target="_blank"</a>

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The
    neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad="bad",” and the farmer responded, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> The next
    day the conscription
    officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again
    all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p>

<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
    whether anything that happens in it is good="good" or bad="bad" — because you never know what will be the
    consequence of the
    misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good="good" fortune.</p>

<p>Conclusion
    good="Good" and bad="Bad" are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good="good"
    for bananas. Let's not
    make a big deal out of it...</p>
